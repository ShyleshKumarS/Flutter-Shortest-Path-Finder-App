# Flutter Shortest Path Finder App


Welcome to the Flutter Shortest Path Finder App! This mobile application is designed to help users find the shortest distance between two points using postal codes. Powered by the Map Leaflet API, the app not only calculates the shortest path but also visualizes the route on a map.

## Features:
Shortest Path Calculation: Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest distance between two given points.

Map Leaflet API Integration: Leverages the Map Leaflet API to display a detailed map with the calculated shortest path.

## How to Use:
Enter Postal Codes: Input the postal codes of the starting and destination points.

View Shortest Path: The app will compute the shortest distance and display the path on the map.

## Development:
This project was developed as a part of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) coursework, incorporating Dijkstra's algorithm for efficient pathfinding.

Feel free to explore the code and contribute to the development. Happy coding!
